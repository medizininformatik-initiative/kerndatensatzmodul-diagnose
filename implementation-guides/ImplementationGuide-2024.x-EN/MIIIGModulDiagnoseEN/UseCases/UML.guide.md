## UML
A UML class diagram has been created in order to provide a more abstract version of an information model and to clarify the relationships between the concepts. Concepts mapped as groups in ART-DECOR are modeled as separate classes, which have association relationships to each other. Characteristics of the person and the case are displayed in a different color from those of the diagnosis.
